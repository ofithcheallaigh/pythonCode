# Booleans - data type. Just like a switch, either True or False
# Variables can be used to store booleans:
a = True
b = False

# Variable examples
my_int = 7
my_float = 1.23
my_bool = True

# Reassigning variables
my_int = 9
my_int = 3
print(my_int)

# Whitespace
# In python, whitespace is sued to structure code. Whitespace is important, so you have to be careful
# with how you use it. Below is badly formatted code, and produces an error
def spam():
eggs = 12
return eggs
  
print spam()

# Correct formatting is:
def spam():
	eggs = 12
	return eggs

print spam()
